This is my personal website (static version, i.e no backend) since I am too broke to pay for hosting.

Previously this site ran using Django and Postgres as a backend, but hosting fees are more than I  can hanlde right now so currently this is using GitHub pages and plain old CSS and HTML.

Check the site out [here](http://luispadron.com).

Take a look at the original site [here](https://github.com/luispadron/Website).
